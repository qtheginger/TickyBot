        <h2>What Is TickyBot</h2>
        <p>TickyBot is a Slack Bot that lets you use 
          support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't 
          need to leave your beloved channel to assist 
          your users, if you don't feel like it.</p>
        <p>With TickyBot you can easily check if you've 
          received new tickets, change their status, or 
          write a reply, and the ticket will instantly 
          update itself on our site.</p>
        <p>Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.

            support ticket so other admins could look into the issue.</p>
